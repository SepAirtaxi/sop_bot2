# Using SharePoint

## Scope

This SOP covers the general use of the Copenhagen AirTaxi SharePoint site, including navigation, file access, tool/material requests, and the Information Hub. For aircraft-specific documentation or technical records, refer to the relevant aircraft documentation SOPs.

## 1. Overview

SharePoint is the central hub for shared data and information at Copenhagen AirTaxi. Access the site at: [https://aircat1.sharepoint.com/sites/TekniskAfdeling](https://aircat1.sharepoint.com/sites/TekniskAfdeling)

The main menu runs along the top of the SharePoint site. The front page displays the **CAT Bulletin**, which contains internal news and announcements.

> **Tip:** To expand a sub-menu (indicated by an arrow symbol), hover over the arrow rather than clicking it. Clicking the arrow will navigate to the parent directory instead of revealing the sub-menu.

---

## 2. Departments Menu (File Browser)

The **Departments** menu provides access to internal files through a browser-based interface. The view is access-based, so you may not see folders or directories for which you lack permissions.

> **Note:** It is generally preferable to access these files directly through your PC's file browser, as the same directory structure is available locally.

---

## 3. Tool/Material Request System

This system handles requests for non-aircraft related items such as tools, work wear, facility materials, and similar supplies. All purchasing requests should go through this channel to ensure proper tracking and follow-up.

### 3.1 Submitting a Request

1. **Open the Request Form:** Click **Send New Request** in the menu.
2. **Complete the Form:** Fill in all fields in the request form.
3. **Submit:** Click **Submit** to send the request to the logistics team.

A notification is automatically sent to the logistics team upon submission.

---

### 3.2 Checking Request Status

1. **View Active Requests:** Click **See Request Status** to view all active requests.
2. **View Completed Requests:** Click the **Completed Requests** tab on the right.

> **Note:** A request is only marked as completed once the ordered item has been physically received.

Once logistics has acknowledged and ordered the item, the **Status** column updates from *Not Ordered* to *Ordered*. Additional information appears in the **Comment** column.

---

### 3.3 Processing Requests (Logistics Team)

This section applies to logistics team members responsible for processing incoming requests.

#### Approved Suppliers

All non-aircraft items should be ordered from approved suppliers whenever possible. The following suppliers have VAT-exempt purchasing accounts:

- DMT Værktøj
- Würth
- Biltema
- Stark
- Lomax

> **Important:** If a mechanic has requested a specific product found online and our approved suppliers do not stock it, liaise with the requester to find an acceptable alternative from an approved supplier.

#### Updating Request Status

1. **Open the Request:** Double-click the request in the list to open it.
2. **Navigate to the Comment Field:** Scroll down to the **Comment** field.
3. **Add a Status Comment:** Enter your initials and a brief status note (e.g., `SEP: Ordered from Würth on 01/01/2026`).
4. **Update the Ordered Status:** Change the ordered status accordingly.
5. **Mark as Received:** Once the item is physically received, change the **Received** status from *No* to *Yes*.

## 4. Links

The **Links** section contains a curated collection of useful resources for the entire department.

---

## 5. Information Hub

The **Information Hub** provides access to four key resources:

| Resource | Description |
|---|---|
| **Aeroshell Product List** | Look-up table of internal part numbers for all Aeroshell products. Use this to identify part numbers for specific quantities or packaging types. |
| **Passwords** | Master list of login credentials for all company websites. Strictly for CAT employees — must never be shared externally. Update this list whenever credentials change. |
| **Safety Data Sheets** | Contains login credentials and access link to the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) database. |
| **Service Supplier List** | Index of external service suppliers for non-aircraft items (facility maintenance, tool rental, service vehicles, etc.). Update this list when engaging new suppliers. |

> **Important:** Always update the **Passwords** sheet when you change login credentials, and update the **Service Supplier List** when you begin working with a new supplier.
