# Daily and Recurring Tasks — Sales & Logistics

## Scope

This document provides an overview of the daily and recurring tasks performed by the Sales & Logistics team. It serves as a quick reference guide for prioritizing work and understanding departmental responsibilities. For detailed step-by-step procedures on specific tasks (e.g., order receiving, component returns), refer to the dedicated SOP for each process.

## 1. Monitor Part Requests

Part requests come from two sources and should be checked regularly throughout the day.

### 1.1 Internal Requests

Internal requests are parts requested by our own mechanics directly in AMS.

1. **Open AMS.**
2. **Navigate** to Inventory Manager → Requisition List.
3. **Sort** by clicking the **Req. #** column header to show the newest requests at the top.
4. **Review and action** any new requests.

### 1.2 External Requests

External requests come from external customers or satellite locations via the SharePoint requisition list.

1. **Open** the requisition list via SharePoint.
2. **Check** for new requests that have not been actioned.
3. **Mark** the **Sourcing** column for any new requests so colleagues know you have initiated sourcing.

---

## 2. Non-Aircraft Item Requests

Non-aircraft items include tools, consumables, materials, and clothing. These use a separate requisition form on SharePoint, and notifications arrive in the shared email inbox when new requests are submitted.

### 2.1 Approved Suppliers

Always order non-aircraft items from approved suppliers. We have VAT-exempt purchasing accounts with the following:

- DMT Værktøj
- Würth
- Biltema
- Stark
- Lomax

> **Note:** Mechanics often include links to specific products they found online. If our approved suppliers don't carry that exact item, liaise with the requester to find an acceptable alternative from our approved supplier list.

After actioning a request, update the ordered status and add a brief comment with the current status.

## 3. Part Sourcing and Procurement

When a part request needs action, the first step is to investigate availability and cost.

### 3.1 Sourcing Methods

There are several ways to locate parts:

- **ILS/Partsbase** – online parts marketplaces
- **AMS order history** – check previous purchases for the same part number
- **Colleagues** – ask the team which suppliers may carry the part

> **Note:** Some parts are manufacturer-exclusive, meaning only the OEM can quote or sell them. In these cases, lead time and cost are typically fixed, and maintenance must be planned accordingly.

### 3.2 Procurement Decision Factors

When multiple suppliers are available, consider the following factors to maximize efficiency and minimize transit time and shipping costs:

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Item lines | How many item lines do I need? |
| Quantity | What quantity/quantities do I need? |
| Deadline | What is my deadline? |
| Stock | Are the parts fully or partially in stock? |
| Lead time | What is the lead time? |
| Location | Where is the supplier located? |
| Shipping | Does the item require non-standard shipping? |

### 3.3 Procurement of Contracted Components

This section applies specifically to parts ordered for Airseven aircraft.

Airseven has contractual agreements covering most rotable components:

| Supplier | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Aerotron Ltd. | Vast majority of rotable components (with some exceptions) |
| TP Aerospace | All wheels and brakes for the Airseven fleet |

> **Tip:** If you're unsure whether a component is covered by the Aerotron contract, contact our Aerotron representative or check AMS order history for prior purchases.

> **Important:** We have a consignment stock of more than 40 components for Airseven. Always check AMS inventory before procuring via Aerotron. If you forget, Aerotron will notify us if a unit is already in stock.

## 4. Receiving Goods

Incoming shipments arrive almost daily. Some are urgent and task-related, while others are stock replenishment.

| Priority | Type | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| High | Parts required for an active task | Receive as quickly as possible |
| Lower | Stock replenishment items | Receive when time permits, but don't neglect entirely |

> **Important:** The incoming shipment shelf must be cleared by the last day of each month (30th/31st). This is required for proper monthly turnover reporting.

> **Note:** Some shipments are delivered to headquarters landside. The office will notify us when they have received a shipment for us to collect.

---

## 5. Shipping Goods

Outgoing shipments vary in urgency. Always prioritize task-related shipments first.

Common reasons for outgoing shipments include:

- Line station requirements
- Component repair/return
- External sales
- Document shipments

Always ensure appropriate cushioning and packaging. Depending on parcel size, quantity, and destination, either book a standard courier solution or contact our freight agent.

---

## 6. Checking for Expired and Overdue Parts

Parts and tools with time limits must be monitored and removed from inventory if the date is exceeded.

### 6.1 Viewing Time-Limited Items

1. **Open AMS.**
2. **Navigate** to Inventory Manager → Time Expired Part List.
3. **Sort by date** to see the parts closest to expiry at the top.

### 6.2 Types of Time Limitations

| Limitation Type | Action Required |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Calibration cycles | Remove from inventory, send for calibration |
| Inspection / test / overhaul | Remove from inventory, arrange appropriate service |
| Shelf life (e.g., o-rings, first aid kits, lubricants) | Destroy/discard and remove from system — cannot be extended |

> **Note:** All tools requiring calibration have 12 months of validity. We typically send tools for calibration in Q1, staggered to avoid depleting the tool pool entirely.

## 7. Emails

We receive many emails requiring different actions. Remember to check both your personal inbox and the shared department inbox regularly, and take action where necessary.

---

## 8. Processing Core Units and Return Shipments

This section applies specifically to Airseven maintenance tasks.

Airseven's mechanic crew often works nights and weekends. They send task reports to our shared email inbox after completing each task.

1. **Review** task reports in the shared inbox when you clock in.
2. **Look for red tags** in the paperwork. A red tag indicates a component has been replaced and logistics action is required.
3. **Process** the core return according to the relevant procedure.

> **Important:** 95% of core-related tasks involve components from Aerotron or TP Aerospace. We have contractual obligations to return unserviceable units promptly — prioritize red tag items in the inbox.

---

## 9. Processing Green Tag Units

We have an in-house shop for batteries, magnetos, and wheels. When mechanics complete a repair, they place the serviceable component in the warehouse.

Our task is to:

1. **Create** the component record in AMS.
2. **Put it on stock** in the correct warehouse location.

---

## 10. Warehouse and Facility Upkeep

After periods of heavy workload, the warehouse or office may become disorganized. When time permits, take the opportunity to clean up and restore order.

Upkeep tasks include:

- Archive or properly store any documents left out in the open
- Sort packing materials and boxes — decide what to keep and what to discard
- General tidiness in the workspace

> **Tip:** Physical clutter can lead to lost paperwork and frustration for colleagues. Maintaining a tidy environment helps everyone work more effectively.

---

## 11. Return Surplus Parts to Stock

Check the **Return To Stock** box from Hangar 5. This box contains surplus parts from completed tasks — mechanics sometimes don't use all allocated parts.

Review the returned parts and take the necessary action to return them to stock in the warehouse.
