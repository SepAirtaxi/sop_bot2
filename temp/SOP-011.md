# Part Sourcing and Procurement

## Scope

This procedure covers how to identify, source, and order aircraft parts in response to both internal and external part requests. It applies to all logistics personnel responsible for procurement and inventory management.

> **Important:** Part requests are not automatically flagged or notified — it is your responsibility to check the requisition lists regularly and action them in a timely manner.

Related procedures: [[SOP-002]]**Create Purchase Order** & [[SOP-007]]**Ordering Wheels & Brakes for Airseven**

## 1. Internal Requests

Internal requests originate from CAT's own Part-145 organisation and are managed through the AMS Requisition List.

### 1.1 Accessing the Requisition List

1. **Open the list:** In AMS, navigate to **Inventory Manager > Requisition List**.
2. **Filter by status:** Set the **Status** filter to **Open** to display all requisitions that require action. This is the only filter you need to use routinely.
3. **Review the list:** The key columns to pay attention to are:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **Req. #** | Unique requisition number. A single requisition may contain multiple part/tool lines. |
| **Creation Date** | Sort by this to prioritise oldest or newest requests. |
| **Requisitioner** | The person who created the request. Useful when clarification is needed. |

4. **Open a requisition:** Click once on a line in the top window to highlight it. The bottom window will show the individual part lines within that requisition.

> **Note:** The Requisition List does not account for parts already in stock. Each open item line requires manual follow-up in inventory. This is intentional — it ensures no life limits are missed and prevents duplicate purchasing. The process becomes significantly faster with experience and a well-maintained list.

> **Tip:** If you have a large number of open items, note down all part numbers digitally before starting your checks. You will need to search for them repeatedly in AMS.

---

### 1.2 Checking Each Item Line

For each open item line, navigate to **Inventory Manager > Inventory Consultation** and search for the part number (PN). There are four possible outcomes:

#### Scenario 1 — Part is in stock

If sufficient stock exists to cover the request, the item requires no further action.

1. Navigate back to the requisition.
2. Double-click the item line.
3. Change **Status: Open** to **Status: In stock** and click **OK**.

#### Scenario 2 — Part is not in stock

If the requested PN has no stock, check whether an equivalent PN is available:

1. Search for the PN in Inventory Consultation as normal.
2. If the part is linked to alternative part numbers, an **Equivalent Hot Key** button will appear in the top-right of the window. Click it to view all linked alternatives.
3. Highlight each alternative PN in the top window — the bottom window will show available stock.
4. If stock exists under an alternative PN, note down the alternative PN and its storage location.
5. Return to the requisition, change the status to **In stock**, and in the **note field** write:
   ```
   Alt PN: [alternative part number]  Location: [storage location]
   ```
   This note will appear on the picking list, making it easier to identify and retrieve the correct part.

If no stock exists for the requested PN or any alternative PN, the item is **eligible for procurement** and must be added to a Purchase Order.

#### Scenario 3 — Part number does not appear in Inventory Consultation

If a PN returns no result in Inventory Consultation, it is likely a tool rather than a part. Search for it under **Inventory Manager > Equipment Consultation** instead.

#### Scenario 4 — Item is a tool

If the PN is confirmed to be a tool, check two things:

1. **Is the tool in stock?**
2. **Is the tool within its calibration validity?** Open the tool in the tracking number view and check the **Expiration** field.

Many tools are subject to an annual calibration cycle. Tools outside their calibration period are not compliant for use, even if physically available.

> **Warning:** Tools are typically sent for calibration in Q1 each year (staggered to prevent tool pool depletion). Pay close attention to tool expiry dates when actioning requests during this period.

If the tool is in stock and within valid calibration, change its status to **In stock** as described in Scenario 1.

## 2. External Requests

External customers — such as Airseven or Nordic Seaplanes — submit part requests via a live spreadsheet hosted on SharePoint. These requests are not linked to AMS requisitions.

> **Note:** At the time of writing, only Airseven has an active external requisition list. Airseven also has contractual suppliers for over 90% of rotable components.

### 2.1 Accessing the Airseven Requisition Lists

Each Airseven aircraft has its own spreadsheet. Access them via the links below:

| Tail Number | SharePoint Link |
|---|---|
| OY-ASD | [Material Status List OY-ASD](https://robinhoodci.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/RKE-AIR7/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B497753F2-E3DF-49C4-938E-173324FC5728%7D&file=Material%20Status%20List%20OY-ASD.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) |

The spreadsheet is used by three parties: Airseven Fleet Managers, GMT, and CAMO. All three can add requests, usually in a coordinated effort.

---

### 2.2 Reading the Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet uses colour-coded columns:

- **Yellow cells** — information entered by Airseven/GMT/CAMO. You read from these.
- **Blue cells** — logistics responsibility. You update these.

**Yellow columns (read):**

| Column | Field | Description |
|---|---|---|
| B | Description | Description of the requested part. |
| C | Part Number | The requested PN. |
| D | Qty | Quantity required. |
| E | Request By | Who submitted the request. |
| F | Request Date | When the request was submitted. |
| G | Due Date | Deadline for installation on the aircraft — not the delivery deadline. |
| I | Remarks | Additional notes from Airseven/GMT/CAMO. |

**Blue columns (update):**

| Column     | Field Name         | When to update |
|---|---|---|
| A          | Completed          | Check once the item has been successfully delivered to the line station. |
| J          | Sourcing           | Check immediately when you register and begin actioning a request. |
| K          | Ordered            | Check once the order is placed with the supplier, or if already in stock. |
| L          | Stock RKE          | Check once the item is received at the RKE logistics hub. |
| M          | Sent to Line       | Check once the part is delivered to the line station. Also triggers column A. |
| N          | CAT PO             | Enter the internal PO number (CAT-XXXX) once the order is placed. |
| O          | Vendor             | Name of the supplier. |
| P          | ETA                | Estimated date of arrival. |
| Q          | Comment            | Running notes on progress: AWB, delays, delivery contact, or final AWB to line. |

> **Note:** Wheels and brakes are not ordered through the spreadsheet. Refer to [[SOP-007]]**Ordering Wheels & Brakes for Airseven** for that process.

### 2.3 Actioning a New Request

A line without a check mark in the **Sourcing** column (J) is a new, unactioned request.

1. **Check off Sourcing (column J)** immediately to signal to Airseven and GMT that you have registered the request.
2. **Search for the PN** in AMS Inventory Consultation to determine the part type and check for existing stock.

**If the part is already in stock:**

1. Check off **Sourcing**, **Ordered**, and **Stock RKE** (columns J, K, L).
2. Enter `Pack` in the **ETA** field (column P) as a reminder to pick and pack the item from inventory in time.

**If the part is a rotable component:**

Rotable components can be difficult to identify from a PN and description alone. When in doubt, ask a colleague or Airseven, or perform a quick search online.

- **Wheels or brakes:** Refer to [[SOP-007]]**Ordering Wheels & Brakes for Airseven**.
- **Other rotable components:** These are very likely covered by the Aerotron contract. Check AMS for any previous order history on the PN — this is often the case for Boeing components that rotate frequently. If no history is found, search ILS or contact Aerotron directly to confirm contract coverage.

> **Important:** CAT maintains a consignment stock of over 40 components for Airseven. **Always check AMS inventory before placing an order with Aerotron.** If you overlook this, Aerotron will flag it, but verifying first saves time.

Once contract coverage is confirmed, refer to [[SOP-002]]**Create Purchase Order** for the steps required to raise the order. Orders to Aerotron should be sent to:

```
ContractsEMEA@Aerotron.Group
CC: flyservice@aircat.dk
```

**If the part is a consumable not in stock:** Continue to Section 3.

## 3. Sourcing Parts

When a part requires procurement, the first step is to investigate availability and pricing.

**Sources to check:**

- **ILS / Partsbase** — online aviation parts marketplaces.
- **OEM suppliers** — via their websites or by email.
- **AMS order history** — search for previous purchases of the same PN to identify known suppliers.
- **Colleagues** — the team may know which suppliers carry specific parts.

> **Note:** Some parts are manufacturer-exclusive, meaning only the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) can quote or supply them. In these cases, lead time and cost are fixed. With experience, you will learn to recognise exclusive part numbers by their specific prefixes, suffixes, or formatting conventions.

---

### 3.1 Procurement Decision Factors

When sourcing from multiple potential suppliers, evaluate the following factors to minimise transit time and cost:

| Factor | Question to Ask |
|---|---|
| **Item lines** | How many different part numbers do I need? |
| **Quantity** | What quantities are required? |
| **Deadline** | What is the due date for installation? |
| **Stock** | Are the parts fully or partially available? |
| **Lead time** | How long will delivery take from each supplier? |
| **Location** | Where is the supplier located relative to the destination? |
| **Shipping** | Does the item require special handling or non-standard shipping? |

These factors vary with every requirement. There is no fixed formula — assess each situation individually and select the supplier combination that best meets the operational need.

## 4. Ordering Parts

Once you have determined what to order and from which supplier(s), proceed with the ordering process as described in [[SOP-002]]**Create Purchase Order**.
