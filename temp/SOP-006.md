## 1. Initial Services

When a customer places an order via email or phone, the first step is to determine whether the item(s) are already in stock.

### 1.1 Option A: Item Is in Stock

Look up the part number in AMS and identify its warehouse location.

> **Tip:** Print the label before heading to the warehouse — it contains the PN, description, and location, making it easier to find and verify the correct part.

Once retrieved, proceed to **Pack & Prepare the Part** below, then continue to Step 2.

### 1.2 Option B: Item Is Not in Stock

Investigate the cost and lead time for the item (refer to [[SOP-003]]**Creating New Entities**). Customers will typically request this information before committing, so provide a quote including lead time before placing any order.

> **Important:** Always apply the customer-related markup when quoting. Refer to the Pricing section on CAT Onboard for current markup brackets. Prices given to customers are **always** inclusive of markup, exclusive of VAT, and exclusive of shipping — unless otherwise specified.

If the customer accepts the quote, place the order with the supplier. Once it arrives, receive it in the system per [[SOP-004]]**Goods Receiving**, then proceed to **Pack & Prepare the Part** below and continue to Step 2.

### 1.3 Pack & Prepare the Part

Regardless of whether the item was in stock or freshly received, prepare it for the customer as follows:

- **Bagged items** (bulk items or partial batches): Place the part in a new bag, apply the label to the bag, and include the printed certificate inside.
- **Boxed items** (parts in their own packaging): Attach the required certificate documentation inside or outside the box.

The result should be a complete, self-contained package — labelled, with the part and its certificate together.

### 1.4 Verify Customer Entity

Before creating the invoice, confirm the customer exists in the system and note the **TN** (transaction number) of the item(s) being sold, as it is required in the next step.

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Customer already exists in AMS | Proceed to Step 2 |
| New B2B customer, not yet in AMS | Refer to [[SOP-003]]**Creating New Entities**, then proceed to Step 2 |
| Private individual, over-the-counter purchase | Refer to [[SOP-010]]**Over the Counter Sales** |

## 2. Create an Invoice

1. **Open Invoicing Manager:** From the AMS home screen, navigate to **Invoicing Manager > Invoices Consultation**.
2. **Create a New Invoice:** Click the **+ Add** button in the bottom left corner. Select the correct customer from the dropdown and click **OK**. When prompted for a related aircraft, this is optional — click **OK** to continue.
3. **Fill in the Invoice Header:** Complete the following fields:

   | Field | Instructions | Example |
   |---|---|---|
   | **Subject** | General headline for the invoice | `John // Oil Filter // OY-ABC` |
   | **Auth.** | Your initials followed by the same text as the Subject (this field appears in the invoice list, Subject does not) | `SEP // John // Oil Filter // OY-ABC` |
   | **VAT/MOMS** | Tick box at the bottom right. Check for most customers. Leave **unchecked** for VAT-exempt aviation operators. | — |

   > **Tip:** To verify if a customer is VAT-exempt, search Google for **"Liste over anerkendte luftfartsselskaber"** (SKAT's official list). The list contains fewer than 25 companies, so this is rarely applicable.

4. **Add the Item(s):** Click **Add Item**, select the **Items** tab, and perform an exact search by TN. Highlight the item, set the quantity to match what was sold, and click **OK**.
5. **Add Shipping (if applicable):** Highlight the item line and click **Change Freight** to enter a shipping fee.

> **Tip:** Note the invoice's 4-digit running number shown at the top of the invoice view — you will need it in the next step.

## 3. Submit Invoice to Finance

1. **Generate the Invoice Document:** From the main invoice view, click **Report > Preview Invoice/Op. Cost**. This opens an internal Word document with the invoice details (this is not the customer-facing invoice).
2. **Save as PDF:** Save the document as a PDF using the exact filename format:
```
   Attachment XXXX.pdf
```

   Replace `XXXX` with the 4-digit invoice number retrieved in Step 2.

3. **Send to Finance:** Compose a new email and populate it exactly as follows:
```
   To:      dll@aircat.dk
   Subject: Attachment XXXX
   Attach:  Attachment XXXX.pdf
```

Once sent, the process is complete. Finance will handle sending the final invoice to the customer.
