# Goods Receiving (EU Shipments)

## Scope

This procedure covers receiving goods ordered from within the EU. It includes physical inspection, system receiving in AMS, labelling, storage, and document archiving.

> **Note:** For non-EU shipments, refer to [[SOP-005]]**Import and End-Use Certification** first, then return to this procedure.

---

## 1. Physical Inspection

Before processing any shipment in the system, perform a physical inspection of the received goods.

### 1.1 Check the Shipping Box

- Visually inspect the box for any signs of damage (dents, punctures, water damage).
- If significant damage is present, document it before opening.
- If the box appears acceptable, proceed with opening.

### 1.2 Unpack and Sort

- Remove all parts and accompanying paperwork from the box.
- If multiple items were ordered, bundle each part with its corresponding paperwork to keep things organized.

### 1.3 Verify Serialized Items

For any serialized parts, confirm that the part number (PN) and serial number (SN) on the physical part match the information stated on the accompanying paperwork.

### 1.4 Check Documentation

Ensure each item has the required certification paperwork:

- Certificate of Compliance (COC), or
- EASA Form 1, or
- FAA 8130-3

Verify that the specific item you received is listed on the certificate.

## 2. System Receiving

Once physical inspection is complete, proceed with receiving the items in AMS.

### 2.1 Scan and Rename Documentation

1. **Select the Item:** Choose the first item you want to receive.
2. **Scan the Paperwork:** Scan all related documentation for that item.
3. **Rename the File:** Rename the scanned file using the certificate type and reference number.

File naming examples:

```
EASA 123-ABC.pdf       (for EASA Form 1)
COC ABC-123.pdf        (for Certificate of Compliance)
```

### 2.2 Navigate to Purchase Order Receiving

4. **Open AMS.**
5. **Navigate** to **P.O. Manager → Purchase Order Receiving**.
6. **Search** for your order using the search function.
7. **Open the Order:** Double-click the order in the top window.

> **Note:** This view only shows orders with unreceived items. Once all items on an order are received, it disappears from this list.

### 2.3 Check the Order Reference

Before receiving, determine what the part was ordered for:

- Check the **Reference** field (top right), or
- Scroll right on the item line to find the **Note** field.

This tells you whether the part should go to warehouse stock or directly to a specific aircraft.

### 2.4 Receive the Item

Double-click the item line to begin receiving. Two pop-up windows will appear:

**Pop-up 1: Quantity and Part Number**

| Field | What to Do |
|---|---|
| Quantity | Enter the number of units you are receiving. For partial deliveries, enter only what you received — the balance will remain pending. |
| Part Number | If you received the same PN as ordered, click **Save**. If receiving an alternative or equivalent PN, check the **Equivalent** box and enter the correct PN. |

> **Important:** Always double-check that the part number is entered exactly as shown on the physical part and paperwork.

**Pop-up 2: Release Note Information**

For **EU shipments:** Enter the certificate reference in the **Release Note Number** field (same as your scanned file name, e.g., `EASA 123-ABC`). Click **OK**, then **Next**. Leave the **Airway Bill** field blank.

For **non-EU shipments:** Follow the [[SOP-005]]**Import and End-Use Certification** first, then enter the customs case ID (e.g., `2026142273756`). Use the **Waybill Number** field to indicate the release type:

| Value | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `END-USE` | Parts released on End-Use certificate |
| `CERT` | Parts released on Airworthiness Release |

**Serial Number Entry (if applicable)**

For serialized items, a third pop-up will appear asking for the serial number. Enter it exactly as shown on the paperwork and physical part, then click **Next**.

### 2.5 Update Item Data

The tracking number view displays all item information. Update the following fields:

**Location**

- *For warehouse stock:* Enter the location code where you will store the part. Use the standard location if one exists for this part type. If not, consult the *Part Locations Master List* to find an appropriate bin.

  Location code format:

  | Code | Meaning |
  |---|---|
  | `C19-B-3` | Rack 19, Shelf B (2nd from top), Bin 3 (3rd from left) |

  > **Note:** The `C` prefix indicates the part was verified during the warehouse inventory transfer.

- *For aircraft allocation:* Enter the location as `C-[TAIL NUMBER]`.
  - Standard format: `C-OY-CAT`
  - Airseven Boeings: `C-AIRSEVEN-ASD` (last 3 digits of tail number)

**Price**

Set the sales price using the percentage buttons or enter a custom price. Refer to the **'Pricing'** menu in CAT Onboard for the correct markup based on customer type.

Add the current **Freight Fee** (check the logistics office wallboard for the current rate):

- Only charge one freight fee per box/shipment.
- If receiving multiple items in one box, add freight to only one item line.
- If receiving multiple units on one line, divide the freight by quantity (e.g., 500 DKK ÷ 5 units = 100 DKK per unit).

> **Tip:** Look for an item line with quantity 1 to avoid doing the freight calculation.

**Condition**

Select the condition as stated on the certificate (new, used, repaired, overhauled, etc.).

**Base**

| Value | When to Use |
|---|---|
| `EKRK-Hangar 5` | Default — use in most cases |
| `PART 145 - EKRK B737` | Only when receiving parts for Airseven warehouse stock (not for parts going directly to aircraft) |

**Expiration**

If the part has a shelf life or expiration date, enter it here in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. This applies to consumables (o-rings, chemicals) and rotable components with service intervals. Find this date on the certificate or part packaging.

**Document Manager**

8. **Open Document Manager:** Click the **Doc. Manager** button.
9. **Add the Document:** Click **Add → Document**.
10. **Select the File:** Navigate to your scan folder and select the certificate you scanned earlier.
11. **Close** the Document Manager window.

> **Important:** Every part in our system must have documentation attached, regardless of condition.

## 3. Labelling and Storage

### 3.1 Print Labels

12. **Print Labels:** Click **Quick Print** twice to print 2 labels.
13. **Label the Part:** Attach one label to the part packaging.
14. **Label the Paperwork:** Attach the second label to the physical paperwork.
15. **Save:** Click **Save** to complete the receiving.

### 3.2 Hardware Parts (CAT Stock)

When receiving hardware (screws, nuts, bolts, washers, pins) for CAT inventory:

- Transfer items to an A5-sized ziploc bag.
- Place the label at the top-center of the bag.
- Store in the allocated warehouse location.

## 4. Airseven Invoicing

> **Note:** This section only applies to parts ordered for Airseven aircraft.

For financial reasons, Airseven warehouse stock cannot retain pricing. Follow this workaround after completing the standard receiving process.

### 4.1 Add to Monthly Invoice

16. **Open Invoicing:** From the AMS home screen, go to **Invoicing Manager → Invoices Consultation**.
17. **Search for Customer:** Search by Customer Name: `Airseven`.
18. **Open the Invoice:** Double-click the relevant tail number invoice (e.g., `SEP // OY-ASD Februar 2026`).
19. **Add the Item:** Click **Add Item**.
20. **Find by Tracking Number:** Use the **Items** tab and search by Tracking Number for an exact match.
21. **Enter Quantity:** Enter the quantity and click **OK**.

> **Tip:** The tracking number is shown on the label you just printed.

### 4.2 Restore Stock Quantity

Invoicing removes the item from stock and sets the quantity to zero. To correct this:

22. **Go to Inventory:** Navigate to **Inventory → Inventory Consultation**.
23. **Search:** Search for the tracking number.
24. **Open the Item:** Double-click the item line to open the tracking number view.
25. **Zero Out Prices:** Set all price values to `0` (zero).
26. **Adjust Quantity:** Click **Adjust Qty** and set to the correct quantity.
27. **Save:** Click **Save**.

## 5. Document Archiving

After all items on an order have been received, archive the physical documentation:

28. **Locate the Binders:** Find the PO archive binders in the logistics office (each binder holds 50 POs).
29. **Find Your Binder:** Locate the binder containing your PO number.
30. **Find the PO Document:** Locate the original PO document inside.
31. **Prepare the Documents:** Hole-punch the received documents.
32. **Attach:** Clip the received documents behind the PO document using a paper clip.
33. **Return:** Place the paperwork back in its location in the binder.
