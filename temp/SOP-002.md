# Creating a Purchase Order

## Scope

This procedure covers creating purchase orders in AMS, including orders sourced from the requisition list and manually entered orders. It applies to all standard parts procurement for Copenhagen AirTaxi and Airseven operations.

> **Note:** For creating new part numbers not yet in AMS, refer to [[SOP-001]]**Create a New Part**.

---

## 1. Creating a New Purchase Order

1. **Navigate to PO Creation:** On the AMS home page, go to **P.O. Manager → Purchase Order Creation**.
2. **Select the Supplier:** Choose the supplier from the list and click **OK**.

---

## 2. Entering Order Header Details

Complete the following fields in the order header before adding items.

### 2.1 Reference

Enter an internal reference so colleagues can identify what the parts are ordered for upon receiving. Typical values include a tail number or a specific task reference.

> **Tip:** If ordering parts for multiple purposes, enter `See notes` in this field and add individual references on each item line instead.

### 2.2 PBH No.

This field only applies to contracted units ordered from Aerotron for Airseven Boeing aircraft. When ordering contracted units from Aerotron to Airseven, select **AERO2601-1** (the Boeing contract number). Leave this field empty for all other orders.

### 2.3 Ship Via

Select the appropriate shipping method based on the supplier's location:

| Origin | Carrier | Account | Account Holder |
|---|---|---|---|
| EU and UK | DHL | 303776815 | K+N |
| US | FedEx | 776036331 | Blue Water Shipping |

For freight forwarder arrangements or self-collection, use **SELF COLLECT** or **TO BE ADVISED**.

### 2.4 Ship To

The default value (**CAT Flyservice**) delivers to Hangarvej B 2 in Roskilde and is correct for most CAT orders.

For Airseven orders requiring drop-ship directly to GMT mechanic locations, use the appropriate station code:

| Ship To Code | Location |
|---|---|
| GMT BLL | Billund station |
| GMT CPH | Copenhagen station |
| GMT AAR | Aarhus station |
| GMT AAL | Aalborg station |

> **Note:** The remaining header fields typically do not require changes for standard orders.

## 3. Adding Item Lines

Items can be added from the AMS requisition list or entered manually.

### 3.1 Adding Items from the Requisition List

> **Important:** The Requisition List serves as a complete overview of all parts and tools required for a given task. Always verify each item on the requisition against current stock — the list does not account for parts or tools already available in inventory.

1. **Open the Import Dialog:** In the bottom left corner of the window, click **Import → Import from requisition list**.
2. **Select the Item:** Click once to highlight the relevant item in the list.
3. **Export to PO:** Click **Export to P.O.** in the bottom left corner.
4. **Repeat:** Repeat for each item you need to add to the purchase order.

### 3.2 Adding Items Manually

1. **Open the Search Dialog:** Click the **Add Part** button below the item window.
2. **Search for the Part:** Enter a partial or complete part number (e.g., entering `123` will show all parts starting with 123).
3. **Select the Part:** Click the correct part in the results list to highlight it.
4. **Enter Quantity:** Enter the quantity in the **Qty** field on the left.
5. **Confirm:** Click **OK** to add the item to the purchase order.

> **Important:** Enter the full part number whenever possible to eliminate the risk of selecting the wrong part.

> **Note:** If the part number does not exist in the system and needs to be created, follow the *Creating New Parts* procedure.

### 3.3 Completing Item Line Details

Each item line has 13 columns. Complete the following fields for each item:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cond.** | Part condition as stated by the supplier in the quote. Double-click the field and select the matching condition from the list. |
| **Un. Price** | Unit purchase price from the supplier quote. Verify the currency matches the PO header. |
| **Note** | Internal reference (e.g., tail number). Pre-populated for requisition items — do not change. For manual items, add a reference to help identify the need. |

> **Tip:** To adjust the quantity after adding an item, highlight the line and click the **Qty Adjust** button below the window.

## 4. Finalizing and Sending the Purchase Order

1. **Preview the PO:** Click the **Preview** button at the bottom of the window.
2. **Note the PO Number:** A Word document opens with your PO. The PO number is automatically assigned and displayed at the top.
3. **Sign the Document:** Print the document, then sign and date it.

> **Note:** You may need to manually adjust the Word document if the template doesn't fit everything on one page.

### 4.1 Placing via Supplier Website

1. **Complete the Order:** Finish the order on the supplier portal.
2. **Enter the PO Number:** Enter your PO number (e.g., `CAT-1234`) in the supplier's reference field.
3. **Proceed to Archiving:** Continue to Section 5.

### 4.2 Placing via Email

1. **Scan the Signed PO:** Scan the signed and dated PO document.
2. **Rename the File:** Rename the scan to the PO number (e.g., `CAT-1234.pdf`).
3. **Attach and Send:** Attach the scan to your email to the supplier.
4. **Include PO Number in Subject:** Add the PO number to the email subject line for easy future reference.

## 5. Archiving the Purchase Order

The PO document serves as the index for all physical documentation received with ordered parts. Proper archiving ensures traceability.

- Locate the correct folder in the physical archive (each folder contains 50 PO numbers).
- Punch holes in the PO document and file it in the folder.
- Maintain chronological order: older PO numbers on the bottom, newer on top.

> **Important:** Always preserve the chronological sequence to ensure consistent document retrieval.
