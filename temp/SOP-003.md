# Creating New Entities in AMS

## Scope

This SOP covers how to create new customers and suppliers (entities) in AMS. The procedure is the same for both entity types.

---

## 1. Navigate to the Correct Section

From the AMS home screen, click either **Customers Consultation** or **Suppliers Consultation** depending on the entity type you are creating.

---

## 2. Enter Entity Data

Fill in the available fields with the relevant details. Key considerations differ slightly by entity type:

| Entity Type | Key Notes |
|---|---|
| **Supplier** | Enter the **legal entity of the billing party** — this is the headquarters or official billing address (i.e., where invoices are sent). Also verify the **Currency** field, as this will determine the currency used on all future orders with this supplier. |
| **Customer** | Fill in standard customer details. No special requirements beyond accuracy. |

---

## 3. Save the Entity

Click **Save** when all fields are filled in. The new entity is now ready for use in AMS.
