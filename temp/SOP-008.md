# Processing Aerotron Core Units

## Scope

This procedure covers the complete process for handling Aerotron core units, including creating tracking numbers in AMS, linking exchange and core units, generating required documentation, and coordinating shipment back to Aerotron.

Use this procedure when processing rotable parts received on exchange terms from Aerotron that require core returns.

---

## 1. Gather Required Information

Before starting at the computer, collect all necessary information for each core unit. This saves time and prevents interruptions during processing. Check the unit's box and Aerotron's paperwork first — most details (exchange PN/SN/PO number, weight/dimensions) are typically listed there.

Required information for each unit:

- Core PN and Core SN
- U/S tag
- Exchange PN, Exchange SN, and Exchange TN (TN is optional)
- Exchange PO number
- Colli weight and dimensions

---

## 2. Create Documentation Folder

All documentation for this process will be stored in a dated folder within the Aerotron core archive.

1. **Open SharePoint:** Navigate to **Logistics → Airseven → Core Archive → Aerotron**.
2. **Create a new folder:** Name it using today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
3. **Scan the U/S tag(s):** Save them in the folder using the filename: `US tag SN XXX` (where XXX is the serial number).

---

## 3. Create or Update the Core Unit in AMS

The core unit must exist in AMS Inventory before it can be linked to the exchange unit. This section covers finding or creating the tracking number.

### 3.1 Search for the Core Unit's Serial Number

4. **Navigate to:** **Inventory Manager → Inventory Consultation**.
5. **Search by serial number:** Perform a **Ser/Batch#** search for the core unit's serial number.
6. **If the SN is found:** Open the record, upload the U/S tag, change the **Condition** field to `UNSERVICEABLE`, click **Save**, and proceed to Section 4.
7. **If the SN is not found:** Continue to Section 3.2.

### 3.2 Search for the Core Unit's Part Number

The Inventory Consultation screen has two windows in a hierarchy: the top window shows part numbers, and the bottom window shows tracking numbers (units or batches already created under a part number).

8. **Search by part number:** Perform a **Part Number** search for the core unit's PN.

> **Important:** Search for the **core unit's PN**, not the exchange unit's PN. They may differ in dash number or other variants.

9. **If the PN exists:** Proceed to Section 3.4. **If the PN does not exist:** Continue to Section 3.3.

### 3.3 Create a New Part Number

If the part number doesn't exist in AMS, you must create it before adding the tracking number.

10. **Add the part number:** In the top window, click **Add**.
11. **Fill in the required fields:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Part Number | Enter the core unit's PN |
| Description | Enter part description |
| Type | Select appropriate type |
| Model | B737 NG |
| U/M | Select as applicable (usually *Each*) |
| Serialized/Life Limited | Select as applicable |
| Rotable or Consumable | Select as applicable |

12. **Save:** Click **Save**. The part number is now created. Continue to Section 3.4.

### 3.4 Create the Tracking Number

13. **Add a tracking number:** In Inventory Consultation, click **Add** in the bottom window.
14. **Enter the serial number** of the core unit.
15. **Fill in only the following fields:**
    - **Condition:** `UNSERVICEABLE`
    - **Quantity:** `1`
    - Upload the U/S tag in **Doc. Manager**
16. **Save:** Click **Save**. The core unit now exists in AMS Inventory.

---

## 4. Link Exchange and Core Units

With the core unit created, you can now link it to the exchange unit and generate the core exchange documentation. Have the exchange PO number and exchange unit's SN (or TN) ready.

### 4.1 Locate the Exchange Unit

17. **Navigate to:** **P.O. Manager → Purchase Order Consultation**.
18. **Search by PO number:** Perform a **PO #** search for the 4-digit exchange PO number.
19. **Open the purchase order:** Double-click the result in the top window to view all lines ordered on this PO.

### 4.2 Create or Open the Exchange Line

**If a core/exchange line has not yet been created:**

20. **Select the exchange line:** Click once on the exchange unit's part number line to highlight it.
21. **Create the exchange:** Click the **Exchange Creation** button (located in the middle, below the window).

**If a core/exchange line already exists:**

22. **Open the exchange line:** Double-click the line with the part number ending in `XXX-EXCH`. This displays all tracking numbers that have existed under this part number.
23. **Locate the correct unit:** Find the correct exchange unit using the SN or TN.

> **Tip:** Click the **Tracking Number** or **Ser/Batch #** column header to sort the list and find your unit faster.

24. **Open the tracking number:** Double-click the correct line to open the tracking number window.

### 4.3 Check the Core Value Field

In the tracking number window, locate the blue box labeled **Core Value**.

| Core Value shows... | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `0.00` | Unit was previously rotated and already has a core linked | Skip to Section 4.4 |
| *(empty)* | Ready to link a new core | Proceed to Section 4.5 |

> **Note:** AMS can only link one core per exchange unit. If the field already shows `0.00`, you must create a manual document instead.

### 4.4 Create Manual Core Exchange Document (If Required)

> **Note:** This section only applies when the **Core Value** field already shows `0.00` (unit was previously rotated). This workaround is necessary because AMS only allows linking a core/exchange unit once — if a unit has been rotated more than once, the document must be created manually.

Create a manual document using the following format:

| | Exchange | Core |
|---|---|---|
| **PN** | 15800-029-3 | 15800-029-3 |
| **SN** | 15532 | 0594 |
| **Description** | LAVATORY ASSY | LAVATORY ASSY |
| **CAT PO** | CAT-5396 | N/A |
| **CAT TN** | 22607 | 23552 |

25. **Save the document:** Export as a PDF and save it in the date folder.
26. **Name the file:** `Core exchange SN XXX`. Then proceed to Section 5.

### 4.5 Initialize the Core Link in AMS

27. **Enter the core value:** In the **Core Value** field, type `0` and press **Enter**.
28. **Confirm linking:** When prompted to link a core to the unit, click **Yes**.
29. **Close the new window:** A new window will appear — click **Close** (this window is not needed now).
30. **Save:** Click **Save** on the tracking number and return to the AMS home screen.

### 4.6 Link Core Unit in Exchange List Consultation

31. **Navigate to:** **Exchange List Consultation**.
32. **Sort by newest:** Click the **Core #** column header to sort by highest (newest) exchange numbers.
33. **Open your exchange unit:** Your exchange unit should appear at the top with status **No** in the **Processed** column. Double-click this line.
34. **Select the core unit:** At the bottom right, find **Item Core Tracking Number** and click **Select → From Inventory Search Function**.
35. **Search for the core unit** using **Tracking Number** or **Ser/Batch#**.
36. **Confirm the selection:** When the core unit appears in the right-hand windows, click **OK**. The core unit's information will populate the fields.
37. **Generate the document:** Click the **Core P.S. Creation** button at the bottom left.
38. **Confirm the supplier:** When prompted to select a supplier, confirm **Aerotron** is selected and click **OK**.
39. **Process the core unit:** When asked if you want to process the core unit, click **Yes**. AMS will generate a Word document (the core exchange document).

> **Tip:** Copy the core unit's SN before saving — you'll need it for the filename.

40. **Save the document:** Export as a PDF and save it in the date folder with filename: `Core exchange SN XXX`.
41. **Close Word:** Close the Word document **without saving**.

## 5. Generate NIS Document

A Non-Incident Statement (NIS) is required for the shipment.

42. **Open SharePoint:** Navigate to **Logistics → Shipping → PDF Generator**.
43. **Open the generator:** Open `PDF Generator.html` and log in.
44. **Generate the NIS:** Click **NIS Generator** and fill out the required details.
45. **Save the document:** Generate the PDF and save it in the Aerotron core date folder.

## 6. Prepare Shipping Invoice

46. **Open SharePoint:** Navigate to **Logistics → Shipping → PDF Generator**.
47. **Open the generator:** Open `PDF Generator.html` and log in.
48. **Generate the invoice:** Click **Invoice Generator** and fill out the shipping details.

> **Important:** Aerotron requires **DDP incoterms** for all core returns. Ensure DDP is selected.

49. **Save the document:** Generate the PDF and save it in the date folder.

## 7. Book Shipment and Apply Costs
