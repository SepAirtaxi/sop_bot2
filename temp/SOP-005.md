# Import and End-Use Certification

## Scope

This procedure covers the customs clearance and system entry for parts imported from non-EU countries. It applies when you receive shipments that require customs documentation and VAT-exempt processing.

For general receiving of EU shipments or domestic parts, refer to [[SOP-004]]**Goods Receiving**.

---

## 1. Overview

CAT holds an **End-Use Certification**, a legal document confirming we are the final users of our imports. This status allows us to trade and import parts without paying VAT. For non-EU imports, CAT acts as the official **Importer of Record**, meaning we must provide specific instructions to carriers to remain compliant with customs laws.

## 2. Choosing the Best Import Method

We have two ways to import parts VAT-free. Always prioritize using the Airworthiness Release Certificate over our End-Use license whenever possible.

| Priority | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Priority 1 | **Airworthiness Release** | Uses the part's own certification to qualify for VAT exemption. This reduces our administrative workload and legal audit footprint by using the part's documentation instead of our own license. |
| Priority 2 | **End-Use Certification** | Used for parts with lower levels of certification, such as a Certificate of Conformance, that are not automatically VAT-exempt. |

## 3. Phase 1: Providing Customs Instructions

This phase happens before the shipment arrives at our facility. Both DHL and FedEx will send an email when a shipment lands in Denmark.

### 3.1 DHL (Automated)

DHL is set up with pre-provided instructions. They will automatically clear routine DHL Express shipments on our End-Use certification and send the import documents to our inbox. No manual action is required.

---

### 3.2 FedEx (Manual Action Required)

FedEx holds shipments at their Danish hub and will not release them until they receive instructions from us. Follow these steps when you receive a FedEx notification:

1. **Identify the Supplier:** Open the attachment in the FedEx email to see who sent the part. You can usually see supplier and PO info on the paperwork.
2. **Identify the Certificate:** Determine if the part has an Airworthiness Release (e.g., FAA 8130-3 or EASA Form 1) or just a Certificate of Conformance.
3. **Reply to FedEx:** Copy and paste the relevant instruction block below to release the shipment.

#### Template A: Airworthiness Release

Use this template if you have an EASA Form 1 or FAA 8130-3:

```
Importgrundlag/Anvendelse: Til reparation af egne fly (kommerciel luftfart).
Venligst fortold med Luftdygtighedsattest.
Procedurecode: 4000 009
HS Code: 8807300099
Cert ref.: [Enter Type and Document ID here]
Præferencekode: 119
```

#### Template B: End-Use License

Use this template for consumables or parts with only a Certificate of Conformance:

```
Importgrundlag/Anvendelse: Til reparation af egne fly (kommerciel luftfart).
Venligst fortold med vores END-USE bevilling.
Bevillingsnummer: DKEUS220561467
Procedurecode: 4000 962 (Momsfritaget import)
HS Code: 8807300010
Præferencekode: 140
```

> **Note:** Once the instructions have been sent to FedEx, you can expect to receive the "fuldstændig ekspres" documents within 1 to 2 weekdays, which should align with when the shipment arrives at our facility.

## 4. Phase 2: Physical Receiving

This section applies only to non-EU shipments. Confirm the country of origin on the shipping label before proceeding.

Once the customs instructions are processed and the shipment is delivered to our facility, complete the following steps:

1. **Note the AWB:** Copy the Carrier and Air Waybill (AWB) number from the physical box.
2. **Perform Physical Receiving:** Complete physical receiving and inspections as per [[SOP-004]]**Goods Receiving**.
3. **Search the Inbox:** Search the shared email inbox for the AWB number to find the "fuldstændig ekspres" document.
4. **Link to System:** Locate and copy the Case ID and HS Code from the document. These must be linked to the part in the system to complete the receipt.

---

## 5. Phase 3: Processing Customs Documentation in AMS

To finalize the receiving process in AMS, you must extract specific data from the "fuldstændig ekspres" document.

### 5.1 Locating the Case ID

Find the field labeled **Referencenummer** on the document. The ID always starts with the current year (e.g., `2026142273756`). This is the number you must input into the system.

### 5.2 Verifying the HS Code and Release Type

Check the last two digits of the HS code (**varekode**) on the document to determine the correct release type for the system:

| HS Code Ending | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `...10` | Shipment was released on our End-Use certification. |
| `...99` | Shipment was released on the Airworthiness Release. |

### 5.3 Entering Data into AMS

When you have this information, you are ready to start the receiving process in AMS (referring to [[SOP-004]]**Goods Receiving**). Enter the Case ID and the correct release type in the fields when prompted.

| System Value | When to Select |
|---|---|
| `CERT` | Select if the HS Code ends in `99`. The part was imported on the related airworthiness release. |
| `END-USE` | Select if the HS Code ends in `10`. The part was imported on our End-Use license. |

## 6. Handling Missing Customs Documents

Occasionally, shipments may arrive at our facility before we receive the necessary "fuldstændig ekspres" documents from the carrier. This can stall the goods receiving process.

### 6.1 Requesting Missing Documents

To resolve this, promptly contact the carrier's local customs office to request the documents:

| Carrier | Email Address |
|---|---|
| DHL CPH Customs | cphcus@dhl.com |
| FedEx CPH Customs | cphgts@fedex.com |

Use the following format for the subject line. You do not need to write anything in the body of the email:

```
Subject: AWB [Insert AWB Number] Mangler Fuldstændig Ekspres, fremsend venligst ASAP
```

> **Tip:** This will usually prompt them to forward the missing documents within a short time.

### 6.2 Urgent Receiving Procedure

If you cannot wait for the documents to arrive, you may proceed with receiving the goods to ensure they are available for use.

> **Important:** Instead of entering the customs Case ID, enter the Carrier Name and AWB number in the ID field (e.g., `FEDEX 123456789101`). This preserves traceability and allows us to search for the AWB number in the system later.

Once the actual documents are received from the carrier, you must return to AMS and update the entry with the correct Case ID.
