# Ordering Wheels and Brakes for Airseven's Fleet

## Scope

This procedure covers ordering replacement wheels and brakes for Airseven's Boeing 737-800 fleet through our consignment agreement with TP Aerospace (TPA). Use this SOP when a mechanic has performed a wheel or brake change and a consignment replenishment is required.

For other aircraft types or non-consignment parts, refer to [[SOP-002]]**Create Purchase Order**.

---

## 1. Background

Wheels and brakes experience significant operational stress and wear, requiring regular replacement. Copenhagen AirTaxi maintains a consignment stock agreement with TP Aerospace (TPA) to ensure rapid availability of these components.

### 1.1 Consignment Stock

Each aircraft in Airseven's fleet has dedicated consignment stock at its home line station, consisting of:

- 2 main gear wheels
- 2 nose gear wheels
- 1 brake assembly

When a mechanic uses a unit from consignment, you must order a replacement to replenish the stock.

### 1.2 Part Compatibility

Although all aircraft in Airseven's Boeing fleet are the same type (B737-800), components are not always interchangeable. Most nose wheels are swappable between aircraft, but main gear wheels and brakes are linked to specific aircraft. **Always order the exact part number that was used from stock.**

### 1.3 Delivery Timeframes

TPA delivers standard exchange orders within 24 working hours:

| Order Placed | Expected Delivery |
|---|---|
| Before 12:00 noon | Next business day |
| After 12:00 noon | 2 business days |

## 2. Check Inbox for Wheel/Brake Changes

Airseven's mechanic crews often work nights and weekends. After completing maintenance tasks, they send task reports to the shared inbox. For wheel and brake replacements, the tech team typically sends a direct email notification as well.

1. **Check Your Inboxes:** Check both your personal inbox and the shared team inbox.
2. **Look for Red Tags:** Look for document bundles containing a red tag relating to a wheel or brake change.
3. **Proceed if Applicable:** If you find a red tag for a wheel or brake, proceed with this SOP to action a replacement.

> **Note:** The red tag document includes both the **unserviceable (removed)** unit details and the **serviceable (installed)** unit details.

---

## 3. Update Inventory Stock Status

The wheels and brakes stored at line stations are outside the main inventory system. To maintain accurate records, you must manually remove the recently used unit from inventory.

### 3.1 Locate Part Information

The red tag document has two sections:

- **Top section:** Data on the serviceable unit that was just installed
- **Bottom section:** Data on the unserviceable unit that was removed

Extract the **Part Number (PN)** and **Serial Number (SN)** from the **serviceable section at the top**.

### 3.2 Remove from Inventory

1. **Open AMS** and navigate to **Invoicing Manager → Invoices Consultation**.
2. **Search by Customer Name:** Enter `Airseven`.
3. **Open the Invoice:** Double-click the relevant tail number invoice (e.g., *SEP // OY-ASD Februar 2026*).
4. **Add Item:** Click **Add Item**.
5. **Search by SN:** Perform an exact search for the SN you noted in step 3.1.
6. **Confirm:** Highlight the item, set quantity to `1`, and click **OK**.

## 4. Create Dated Folder for Documentation

All documentation for this process is stored in a dated folder within the TPA core archive.

1. **Navigate to the Archive:** Open SharePoint and go to **Logistics → Airseven → Core Archive → TP Aerospace**.
2. **Create a New Folder:** Name it using today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
3. **Save the Red Tag:** Scan the unserviceable tag(s) and save them in the folder using the filename format:

```
US tag SN XXX
```

*(Replace `XXX` with the actual serial number.)*

## 5. Create Replenishment Order

> **Tip:** If you're unfamiliar with the purchase order process, refer to [[SOP-002]]**Create Purchase Order** for detailed instructions.

### 5.1 Set Up the Purchase Order

1. **Create a New Purchase Order** and select **TP Aerospace** as the supplier.
2. **Identify the Line Station:** Check the paperwork to determine which line station the wheel or brake was replaced at.
3. **Set the Ship To:** Click the **Ship To** menu, scroll down to the **GMT (Ground Maintenance Technics)** section, and select the appropriate station:

| Ship To Code | Location |
|---|---|
| GMT BLL | Billund Airport Station |
| GMT CPH | Copenhagen Airport Station |
| GMT AAR | Aarhus Airport Station |
| GMT AAL | Aalborg Airport Station |

### 5.2 Complete the Order

1. **Reference Field:** Enter `Consignment Replenishment` in the **Reference** field.
2. **Add Part:** Click **Add Part** and select the **exact same part number** shown on the GMT documentation.

> **Important:** Always order the same PN that was used from the consignment stock.

> **Note:** You do not need to fill out the **Ship Via** field for TPA orders. TPA automatically arranges delivery through Kuehne + Nagel, and the shipping cost is included in the contract fee.

### 5.3 Save the Purchase Order

Print, sign, and scan the PO. Rename the document appropriately and save it in the dated folder alongside the US tag.

## 6. Create Shipping Invoice

1. **Open the PDF Generator:** Open SharePoint locally in Windows File Explorer and navigate to **Logistics → Shipping → PDF Generator**.
2. **Log In:** Open `PDF Generator.html` and log in.

### 6.1 Invoice Details

Click **Invoice Generator** and fill out the shipping details:

- **From:** Select the relevant GMT line station
- **To:** TP Aerospace

### 6.2 Items Tab

Enter the data for the unserviceable unit(s) being shipped to TPA:

- **Origin:** `DK`
- **Value:** `500`

### 6.3 Colli Tab

Use the **Template** dropdown to select the relevant wheel or brake template. This automatically populates the weight and dimensions fields.

Generate the PDF and save it in the dated folder.

## 7. Create Draft on TPA Portal

Before submitting the exchange request to TPA, you need to create a draft in their **ProControl** portal. One piece of information — **Cycles Since Installation (CSI)** — must be provided by the CAMO and will be entered later.

### 7.1 Access ProControl

1. Navigate to the TP Aerospace ProControl portal: [https://tpas2650.sharepoint.com/sites/ProControl/](https://tpas2650.sharepoint.com/sites/ProControl/)
2. Log in and click **Exchanges** in the top navigation bar.
3. Click the green **+ Routine exchange request** button.

### 7.2 Complete the Exchange Form

Fill out all fields in the pop-up form:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Aircraft | Tail number of the related aircraft |
| Part number OFF | PN of the removed unit being returned |
| SN OFF | SN of the removed unit (select from dropdown) |
| Installed date | Auto-populated — no change needed |
| Removal date | Date from the red tag |
| CSI | Leave blank — CAMO will enter this |
| Pick-Up location | Line station where the removed unit is located |
| Reason for removal | Worn to limit *(unless otherwise stated on red tag)* |
| SN ON | SN of the installed unit (select from dropdown) |
| Exchange order No. | PO number from the replenishment order |
| Ship-To location | Line station where the new unit should be delivered |
| Notes | Leave blank |
| Has there been an incident? | Select **No** |

### 7.3 Attach Documents

In the attachments section at the bottom of the form, upload the **PO** and **shipping invoice** from the dated folder.

> **Important:** Do not attach the red tag document.

### 7.4 Save the Draft

Click **Save Draft** at the bottom of the pop-up. The exchange request is now saved as a draft and accessible to you and your colleagues.

## 8. Request Cycle Info from CAMO

The **CAMO (Continuing Airworthiness Management Organisation)** must provide the **CSI (Cycles Since Installation)** data. Only the CAMO can extract this information, and only after receiving the paperwork bundle from GMT.

### 8.1 Send Email Request

Send the following email to request the cycle data:

```
To: mtc@aircat.dk
CC: flyservice@aircat.dk
Subject: Please enter cycles on TPA draft

Hi Matic, please enter cycles on the latest draft in the TPA portal and let me know - thanks!
```

> **Important:** The CAMO typically responds quickly, but may occasionally be busy or out of office. Monitor your inbox — if they don't respond before **12:00 noon**, the order may be delayed by an additional business day.

---

## 9. Submit the Exchange Request

Once the CAMO has entered the cycle data, you will receive an email confirmation.

1. **Log back into ProControl** and navigate to **Exchanges → Draft**.
2. **Locate your saved draft** and verify that the **CSI** field has been populated.
3. **Submit:** Click the green **Submit** button to send the exchange request to TPA for processing.

> **Note:** Delivery and pickup are typically handled automatically with minimal action required from logistics.
