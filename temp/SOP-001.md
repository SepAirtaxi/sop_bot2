# Create A New Part

## Scope

This procedure covers how to create a new Part Number (PN) in the system when encountering an unknown part during order creation. This can be done either through the Inventory Consultation view or directly from the PO generation view.

---

## 1. Create a New PN from the AMS Home Window

Navigate to **Inventory Manager** → **Inventory Consultation**. On the upper window, click the **Add** button.

> **Important:** Make sure you click the **Add** button on the **upper** window, not the lower one.

A new pop-up window will appear with multiple fields. You only need to fill in the following:

| Field | What to Enter |
|---|---|
| **Part Number** | The exact part number for the new part. |
| **Desc.** | A short description of the part, e.g. `BOLT` or `RELAY, AUTO PILOT`. |
| **Type** | Select the part type from the drop-down menu. Exact precision is not critical here. |
| **Model** | The applicable aircraft model, if specific. Leave blank if unsure. |
| **U/M** | Unit of measurement. Use `Each` in 90% of cases — only deviate for parts bought by weight, length, or volume (e.g. liquids and chemicals). |
| **Serialized / Life Limited** | Check one or both boxes if the part has a serial number or shelf life. Leave both blank if neither applies. |
| **Rotable / Consumable** | Select one of these two options. This field cannot be left blank. |

Once all relevant fields are filled in, click **Save**. The new part number is now ready to use.
