# Over the Counter Sales

## Scope

This procedure covers walk-in customer sales at the CAT Flyservice store. It applies when a customer physically visits to purchase parts — typically oil, spark plugs, or filters for small General Aviation (GA) aircraft. Over-the-counter (OTC) sales are infrequent, and customers are almost exclusively private individuals (B2C).

For part sourcing, refer to [[SOP-011]]**Part Sourcing and Procurement**. For invoicing details, refer to [[SOP-006]]**Invoicing Customers**.

## 1. Assessing the Customer's Need

1. **Establish availability:** Determine whether the requested item is in stock or needs to be procured and shipped to RKE.
2. **Gather customer information:** Collect the following details — you will need them later for the invoice:
   - Full name
   - Address
   - Phone number
   - Email address

> **Note:** Note down the customer's information straight away so it is ready when you create the invoice.

## 2. Pricing

1. **Existing parts:** If the part already exists in AMS, advise the customer of the retail price shown in the **Tracking Number** view.
2. **New parts to be procured:** Follow [[SOP-011]]**Part Sourcing and Procurement** to source the item, then apply a markup in accordance with the pricing list for general customers.

> **Important:** All prices are **excluding VAT (MOMS)**. When conducting B2C business, you are legally required to inform the customer that the stated price does not include VAT.

> **Important:** If the part had to be procured and shipping was required, a shipping fee must be added on top of the part price. Always inform the customer of this before proceeding.

## 3. Payment

We accept the following payment methods:

| Method | Details |
|---|---|
| MobilePay | Business number: **26507** |
| Bank transfer / invoice | Requires customer name, address, phone, and email |

> **Note:** Payment by bank transfer requires the customer information collected in Section 1. Ensure this is noted down before the customer leaves.

## 4. Picking and Preparing the Item

### 4.1 Items in Stock

Proceed directly to pick and prepare the item as follows:

- **Bagged items** (bulk items or partial batches): Place the part in a new bag, apply the label to the bag, and include the printed certificate inside.
- **Boxed items** (parts in their own packaging): Attach the required certificate documentation inside or outside the box.

The result should be a complete, self-contained package — labelled, with the part and its certificate together.

### 4.2 Items Not in Stock

Follow [[SOP-011]]**Part Sourcing and Procurement** to buy the required part(s). Once received, prepare the item as described in Section 4.1 above.

## 5. Invoicing

An invoice must be created once the customer has received their order — **regardless of whether they paid by MobilePay or bank transfer**. This ensures inventory movements are tracked and payment by transfer can be collected if needed.

1. **Create a new invoice** in AMS.
2. **Select the customer:** Choose **"CUSTOMER / KUNDE"** from the customer list. This is a dummy entity used for all OTC customers and is not linked to a legal entity.
3. **Enter customer details:** Add the customer's name and contact information in the **Remark** field on the right-hand side of the invoice.
4. **Complete the invoice** by following the standard process described in [[SOP-006]]**Invoicing Customers**.
